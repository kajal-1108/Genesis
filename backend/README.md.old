# Genesis Backend

This directory contains the Express.js backend server for the Genetic Trait Predictor and Family Tree Visualizer application.

## Architecture

The backend follows a RESTful API architecture with the following components:

- **Express Server**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores user data, genetic information, and prediction results
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication system
- **API Routes**: Endpoints for user management, genetic data processing, and ML predictions
- **Python Integration**: Communication with Python ML models for genetic trait prediction

## Directory Structure

```
backend/
├── models/              # MongoDB schemas
│   └── user.js          # User model definition
├── routes/              # API route definitions
│   └── auth.js          # Authentication routes
├── server.js            # Main server entry point
├── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
└── .env                 # Environment variables (not committed)
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

> **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure it's included in your `.gitignore` file.

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server in production mode
npm start

# Start the server in development mode (requires nodemon)
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT

### Genetic Prediction
- `POST /api/predict`: Submit genetic data and receive trait predictions

## Genetic Trait Prediction

The `/api/predict` endpoint currently uses a placeholder prediction model that will be replaced with a more sophisticated machine learning approach. The final implementation will:

1. Accept genetic SNP data from the client
2. Process and normalize the data
3. Pass the processed data to the Python ML model via API
4. Return the predictions with confidence scores and explanations

## Integration with ML Models

The backend will communicate with Python-based ML models through:
- REST API calls to a Flask microservice
- Direct Python subprocess execution with data passing

## Data Security

User genetic data is highly sensitive. The backend implements:
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication
- Data minimization and purpose limitation

## Future Improvements

1. Add comprehensive test suite
2. Implement real-time data processing with WebSockets
3. Set up a caching layer for frequent queries
4. Add detailed logging and monitoring
