# Genesis: Genetic Trait Predictor and Family Tree Visualizer

## Project Abstract
Genesis is an AI-driven system capable of predicting human phenotypic traits based on genomic data. By utilizing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information and applying machine learning algorithms, the system predicts traits such as eye color, height, and possible disease predispositions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are integrated to enhance the transparency and interpretability of model predictions.

An interactive family tree visualizer has been implemented to represent hereditary patterns and genetic relationships across generations. This visualization aids users, healthcare professionals, and genetic counselors in understanding trait inheritance in an intuitive manner. 

The system is developed using Python with frameworks like TensorFlow, Flask, and D3.js for visualization, and ensures secure data storage with privacy compliance.

Overall, the project represents a convergence of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and data visualization to promote awareness of genetic inheritance and proactive healthcare planning. It provides an accessible and educational platform for both researchers and individuals interested in exploring their genetic background.
